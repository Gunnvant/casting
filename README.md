# Casting Agency web service

## Introduction

This is a basic crud app that allows a media company to manage ```actors``` and ```movies``` resources. This app uses:
- flask for backend service
- auth0 for third party authentication
- postgresql for database

## Running project locally

1. Create a database for local unitesting
   
   Login to the psql console and create a database
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   psql> CREATE DATABASE capstone_test;
   ```

2. Create a setup.sh file it should have the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Setup data base path
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://{user}:{pw}@localhost:5432/{database_name}"
# Setup Auth0 credentials
export AUTH0_DOMAIN="gunnvantcoffee.us.auth0.com"
export API_AUDIENCE="casting"
export ALGORITHMS="RS256"
```


3. Now install all the dependencies in a virtual environment using ```pip intsall -r requirements.txt```
4. Now run ```python test.py``` to run all the unitests
5. In order to run the app first run the migrations
   
   ```bash
    python manage.py db init
    python manage.py db migrate
   ```
6. Then run the app:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=run_local
export FLASK_ENV=development
export DEBUG=1
flask run
```
